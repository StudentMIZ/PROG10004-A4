'''Write an OO program that greets the user with a welcoming message and prints the ad hoc mode 
and the sensors brand. Afterwards, the application will ask for the following components of the 
wireless ad hoc sensor network: 1) the total number of deployed sensors, 2) the sensor 
Identification (Id) for each sensor, 3) the number of neighbouring sensors for each sensor, 4) the
geographic distance(s) between a sensor and its neighbouring sensor(s), 5) the oxygen 
percentage level saturated in the blood cells (SpO2), and 6) the temperature measurement for 
each sensor. Afterwards, the application will ask the users to enter the source sensor Id and 
destination sensor Id to route a message and will print the traversed path and the entire graph.'''
